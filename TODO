TODO;

1. Finish implementing currently semi-functional NSWritableCache class.
2. iPad support.
3. MapViewController is supposed to display geographic information: places and geotagged 
Flickr photos.
4. Fix the following ImageViewController bug: image view's positioning messes up when 
ImageViewController is being re-displayed.
