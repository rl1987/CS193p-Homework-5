TODO;

1. Finish implementing currently semi-functional NSWritableCache class.
2. iPad support.


3. MapViewController is supposed to display geographic information: places 
and geotagged Flickr photos.

If mapView's zoom scale is large enough (consider that map view is displaying
stuff on national/international/continental level) it is annotated with pins
that mark Flickr favorite cities. When user zooms in to one of these cities,
map view removes city pins and adds pins that are annotated with information
about photos. Each annotation contains a button that allows one to view picture
via ImageViewController.
